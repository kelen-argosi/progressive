# Progressive

**Progressive** is an Obsidian plugin that displays a progress bar in the file explorer sidebar, showing the percentage of tasks that have been completed across your notes.  
It supports daily, weekly, monthly, or custom notes and can track either the latest, today’s, or all notes in a folder.  
The progress bar color dynamically changes based on completion percentage for quick visual feedback.

## ⚖️ Difference from *progress-tracker*

While both *Progressive* and *progress-tracker* help visualize task completion, **Progressive** is a different approach:

| Feature | Progressive | progress-tracker |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Display Location** | Sidebar (always visible in file explorer) | Inside individual notes |
| **Purpose** | Passive overview of total progress | Per-note task tracking |
| **Setup** | Automatic, no embedding or commands required | Manual embedding (inline in notes) |
| **Customization** | Theme-aware, multicolor, black/white modes | Fixed color and layout |
| **Focus** | Minimalism, zero interaction needed | Detailed tracking inside notes |

In short, **Progressive** gives you *a global visual cue* of how complete your workspace is — without needing to open a single note.
